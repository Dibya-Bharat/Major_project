The scope of the project encompasses the development and implementation of hand gesture recognition algorithms tailored for specific tasks such as volume adjustment, mouse movement and clicking, navigating through image slideshows, controlling music playback, and interacting with a virtual piano interface. 

The Gesture Control application will utilize computer vision algorithms to interpret hand gestures captured through a camera, translating them into commands that manipulate the specified computer functions. The software will be designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that allows users to easily configure and customize gesture controls according to their preferences. Additionally, the application will aim to achieve real-time responsiveness, ensuring that gesture recognition and corresponding actions occur promptly and accurately.
